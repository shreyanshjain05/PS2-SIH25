# Business Model

## Tier 1: Public Awareness Layer (Free)
*   Citizens access live air forecasts & map
*   No login required for basic viewing
*   Login required for data downloads (CSV, GIS, graphs)
*   Push notifications for high-pollution events
*   Ideal for health awareness

## Tier 2: Government Intelligence Layer (Priority Access)
*   Automated alerts to CPCB, DPCC, MoEFCC, IMD
*   Ward-wise & city-wise forecasts
*   Dashboard for decision-making
*   Integration with Smart City servers
*   Helps implement:
    *   Odd-even
    *   Construction/industry restrictions
    *   School safety advisories
    *   Medical emergency preparedness

## Tier 3: Enterprise/Industry API Layer (Paid)
*   High-resolution predictive data
*   Dedicated API endpoints
*   Historical datasets
*   Enterprise support
*   Helps logistics, health tech, media, startups, etc.

### Revenue model:
*   Monthly subscription
*   Per API call pricing
*   Dataset licensing

## 1. Automated Pollution Early Warning System (Aligned with NDMA + IMD Early Warning Framework)
India already has:
*   Cyclone Early Warning
*   Flood Early Warning
*   Heatwave Early Warning
But no structured Pollution Early Warning System. Your system fills that exact gap.

**How it aligns:**
*   NDMA’s National Early Warning Dissemination System (EWDS)
*   Smart Cities’ Integrated Command & Control Centers (ICCC)

**Government use:**
When O₃/NO₂ predicted to spike:
*   Auto-alert to State Pollution Control Boards
*   Auto-alert to District Collectors
*   Public advisory dissemination via SMS/WhatsApp
This is highly actionable and fits India’s existing disaster management structure.

## 2. Health Impact Prediction Module (Aligned with Ayushman Bharat + National Health Mission)
The government is pushing preventive healthcare. Your model predicts:
*   Expected rise in respiratory hospital cases
*   High-risk zones for asthma, COPD
*   Alerts to government hospitals to stock essential medicines

**How it aligns:**
*   Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM)
*   National Programme for Prevention & Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases & Stroke (NPCDCS)
This idea ties pollution forecasting to public health planning.

## 3. Industry Environmental Compliance Scoring (Aligned with MoEFCC’s EIA + Green Rating Framework)
Industries already need:
*   Environmental Clearance
*   Pollution load reports
*   Compliance to norms under the Air Act
Your system can provide:
*   Area-wise pollution contribution analysis
*   Early detection of industrial hotspots
*   Compliance score for industries based on real-time data

**How it aligns:**
*   MoEFCC Environment Impact Assessment (EIA)
*   CPCB–Industry Compliance Monitoring System
*   Green Rating / Green Logistics initiatives
This helps government enforce rules before pollution disasters happen.

## 4. Smart City Integration for Pollution-Based Traffic & Urban Policy (Aligned with Smart Cities Mission + Gati Shakti)
Every smart city has an ICCC (command center). Your system can push:
*   Traffic advisory (pollution rerouting)
*   Construction/industry control alerts
*   School safety advisories
*   Urban planning insights

**How it aligns:**
*   Smart Cities Mission
*   PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan
*   National Clean Air Programme (NCAP)
This fits perfectly into existing digital infrastructure of Indian cities.

## 5. National Clean Air Dataset Hub (Aligned with NCAP + Digital India + Open Data Policy)
Government wants:
*   More transparency
*   More open data
*   More digital environmental monitoring
You provide:
*   One unified hub for O₃/NO₂ forecasts
*   High-resolution downloadable air quality maps
*   Historical datasets for research & policy
*   API for government-approved third parties

**How it aligns:**
*   NCAP (National Clean Air Programme)
*   Digital India OpenGov Data Portal
*   NITI Aayog Data-driven Governance policy
This becomes the official pollution intelligence platform for India.
